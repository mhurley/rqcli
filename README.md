## :clipboard: Setup

##### LEGEND
- Arguments inside `< >` are required.
- Arguments inside `[ ]` are optional.
- Arguments that start with `--` are options.
- Arguments that start with `-` are shortcuts for an option.

##### Step-By-Step Guide
1. Navigate to the folder you want to use for your work with reviews.
1. Get the token from the API.
    - Navigate to the [Reviews Dashboard](https://review.udacity.com/#!/submissions/dashboard).
    - Click on API Access:
    - ![API Access](README/ss_api_access.png)
    - Copy the token.
1. Run `rqcli setup <yourToken>`. Some tokens include dashes (`-`) and these must be in quotes (`"token-with-dashes"`). This **_creates a new folder_** in your current working directory, called `api`, where your token and certifications are stored.
    - The command lets you know if any submissions are currently assigned to you, and also if there are any unread feedbacks from the last 30 days.
    - You can add the option `--notify` to get desktop notifications of any unread feedbacks and active reviews.
1. The most common task when using this CLI, will be to start requesting assignments from the Udacity Reviews API. Do this by using the `assign` command.

## :nut_and_bolt: CLI commands

#### `setup`
- Command: `rqcli setup <token>`
- Description: _Creates a new folder, `api`, in the current working directory, with all the information needed to start authenticating against the Udacity Reviews API. This command combines the four commands, `token`, `certs`, `assigned` and `feedbacks` into one._
- Arguments: `<token>`, your token which you can copy from your dashboard > API Access. Some tokens include dashes (`-`) and these must be in quotes (`"token-with-dashes"`).
- Options: `-n`, `--notify`, uses desktop notifications.

#### `assign`
- Command: `rqcli assign <projectId> [moreIds] --feedbacks --notify`
- Description: _Starts requesting the Udacity Reviews API queue for assignments of the type specified in the commands arguments._
    - The default interval for requesting assignments is 1 second.
    - The default interval for checking assignments is 60 seconds.
    - The default interval for checking unread feedbacks is 5 minutes.
- Arguments: `<projectId> [moreIds...]`, space separated list of project ids to request for.
- Options:
    - `-f`, `--feedbacks`, periodically checks for new feedbacks.
    - `-n`, `--notify`, uses desktop notifications.
- Example Usage: `rqcli assign 144 134 -fn`. This will request an assignment for project 144 and then 134. It will keep doing that in a loop. It will also use desktop notifications to notify the user of new assignments and any unread feedbacks.

#### `money`
- Command: `rqcli money [months] --from <date> --to <date>`
- Description: _Gets all completed reviews and returns an earnings reports for the periods specified by the user._
- Arguments: `[months]`, space separated list of months to report on.
- Options:
    - `-f`, `--from <date>`, date in the format, `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00` , from which to calculate earnings (where YYYY-MM` is required and `DD-T00:00:00` is optional). If the `--to` option is not defined, the period reported on will be from the `<date>` to now.
    - `-t`, `--to <date>`, date in the format, `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00`, to which to calculate earnings (where `YYYY-MM` is required and `DD-T00:00:00` is optional). If the `--from` option is not defined, the period reported on will be from sometime in the 70's to the `<date>`.
- Example Usage: `rqcli money 3 4 --from 2016-01 --to 2016-07-26`. This request will return three earnings reports:
    - An earnings report for the full month of March 2016.
    - An earnings report for the full month of April 2016.
    - An earnings report for the year 2016 up to (but _not_ including) July 26th.
- Tips:
    - If you simply use `rqcli money` you will get a total of all you have earned up to now.
    - To add a month from the previous year, simply use the format `YYYY-MM`.
    - If you add a month that is in the future, the command will return information from the month of the previous year instead.
